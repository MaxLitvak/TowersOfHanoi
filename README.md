This towers-of-hanoi simulation displays two methods of finding the solution. The first one utilizes the regular formula to solve. The other one finds the solution using recursion but with no prior knowledge of the problem.

 - Change the number of rings on line 36.
 - Perform the normal method of solving (fast) by pressing "a"
 - Perform the "no prior knowldege" method by pressing "b." This method takes a long time when the number of rings excedes 5 (5 takes about 10 seconds).
